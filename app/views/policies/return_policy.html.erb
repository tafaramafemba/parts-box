<h1>Return Policy</h1>

<p>This Return Policy outlines the procedures for returning items purchased through the Cart To Car platform. 
</p>

<h2>Eligible Returns</h2>

<p>Returns are generally only accepted for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Damaged Items:** Items that arrive damaged during shipping.</li>
  <li><strong>Incorrect Items:** Items that do not match the description or image in the listing.</li>
</ul>

<p>**Note:** Sellers may offer more lenient return policies at their own discretion. Please refer to the individual product listing for the seller's specific return policy.</p>

<h2>Initiating a Return</h2>

1. **Contact the Seller:** If you believe you have received a damaged or incorrect item, contact the seller directly within **14 days** of receiving the order. 
2. **Provide Evidence:** Be prepared to provide evidence of the damage or incorrect item (e.g., photos, videos).
3. **Seller Response:** The seller must respond to your return request within **48 hours** and provide instructions for returning the item.

<h2>Return Shipping</h2>

<p>The seller is responsible for providing instructions for returning the item. This may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Return Shipping Label:** The seller may provide a prepaid return shipping label.</li>
  <li><strong>Return Shipping Address:** The seller will provide the address to which the item should be returned.</li>
</ul>

<p>The buyer is responsible for securely packaging the item for return and ensuring it is shipped according to the seller's instructions.</p>

<h2>Refunds (if applicable)</h2>

<p>If the seller accepts the return, they will issue a refund to the original form of payment. The timeframe for processing refunds may vary depending on the seller's policies and the payment method used.</p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>

<p>In the event of a dispute regarding a return, both buyers and sellers should attempt to resolve the issue amicably. If a resolution cannot be reached, the buyer may contact Cart To Car support for assistance. Cart To Car may mediate the dispute or take other appropriate action.</p>

<h2>Cart To Car's Role</h2>

<p>Cart To Car acts as a platform and does not mediate or process returns. We encourage buyers and sellers to communicate directly and resolve return issues efficiently.</p>

<p>This Return Policy is subject to change at any time. Please check this page regularly for updates.</p>
